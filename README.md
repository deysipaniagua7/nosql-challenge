# nosql-challenge
This is the repository that holds my Module 12 nosql-Challenge.

Module Overview: The challenge was divided into 3 parts: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up, Update the Database, and Exploratory Analysis.

Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up:  We were asked to import data (“establishment.json”), create a database (“establishments”) and a collection (“uk_food”).

Update the Database: We inserted data for a new restaurant and performed several queries to update their BusinessTypeID, delete multiple documents, perform a count_documents() check and update_many() to convert the data types of several variables.

Exploratory Analysis: We performed several queries to answer the following questions.
1.	What establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2.	Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3.	What are the top 5 establishments with a Rating Value of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, “Penang Flavour”?
4.	How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas. 

The “nosql-challenge” folder contains the following:

•	“Resources” subfolder: Holds the “establishments.json” file dataset . 

•	“NoSQL_analysis starter”: Holds my code for part 3 of the challenge.

•	“NoSQL_setup_starter”: Holds my code for parts 1 and 2 of the challenge.

Please note, I used in-class activities/notes and the following resources to complete my assignments:
